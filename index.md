<h1 style="font-family:timesnewroman;">Who I Am</h1>
<p style="font-family:timesnewroman;">My name is Amie Farabee, I am a senior at Excelsior Springs High School and an associate at Northland Center for Advanced Professional Studies (CAPS) My aspiration is to have a Masters in Computer Science and to become a video game developer.</p>
  <h2 style=font-family:timesnewroman;">Video Game Idea #1</h2>
  <p style=font-family:timesnewroman;">My first project I have been working on is a small multiplayer PC game in a cartoon graphic style about fantasy football with actual mythical characters the player can choose from. There are multiple eras (Egyptian, Greek, Midieval, etc...) that the player can go through and unlock special characters at. Levelling up earns different uniforms for the player's team and different mascots.
